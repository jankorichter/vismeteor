# vismeteor 3.0.0

## New features

- `select_knots()` performs forward/backward stepwise selection of spline
  knots from a candidate set, scoring each fit with a user-supplied function
  (e.g. AIC/BIC). Supports a "bulk removal" mode for backward selection and
  optional parallel scoring via the `parallel` package. See
  `?select_knots` and the new `vignette("select_knots")` for details.

## Breaking changes

Naming overhaul: all dotted and camelCase public identifiers were migrated to
`snake_case` to align with the tidyverse / r-lib convention and to eliminate
visual confusion with S3 dispatch (`print.foo`). The d/p/q/r distribution
prefixes (`dvmgeom`, `pvmideal`, ...) are unchanged.

### Renamed exported functions

| 2.1.0                | 3.0.0                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| `freq.quantile`      | `freq_quantile`             |
| `vmgeomVstFromMagn`  | `vmgeom_vst_from_magn`      |
| `vmgeomVstToR`       | `vmgeom_vst_to_r`           |
| `vmidealVstFromMagn` | `vmideal_vst_from_magn`     |
| `vmidealVstToPsi`    | `vmideal_vst_to_psi`        |

### Renamed exported parameters

| 2.1.0             | 3.0.0              |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `lim.magn`        | `lim_magn`         |
| `magn.id`         | `magn_id`          |
| `rate.id`         | `rate_id`          |
| `session.id`     | `session_id`       |
| `perception.fun`  | `perception_fun`   |
| `sun.alt.max`     | `sun_alt_max`      |
| `moon.alt.max`    | `moon_alt_max`     |
| `deriv.degree`    | `deriv_degree`     |
| `withSessions`    | `with_sessions`    |
| `withMagnitudes`  | `with_magnitudes`  |

`lower.tail` is preserved to match base R conventions (`pnorm`, `pgeom`, ...).

### Renamed data.frame columns from `load_vmdb_*` and the example datasets

The imo-vmdb API already uses snake_case; mappings are now reduced to a few
semantic renames. Most dotted column names (`shower.code`, `period.start`,
`sl.start`, `lim.magn`, `t.eff`, `sun.alt`, `moon.alt`, `field.alt`,
`radiant.alt`, `magn.mean`, `location.name`, `observer.id`, ...) become their
snake_case equivalents. `time.sidereal` becomes `sidereal_time`. The example
datasets `PER_2015_rates` and `PER_2015_magn` were regenerated with the new
column names.

### Other breaking changes

- The default for `perception_fun` is now `vmperception` (previously `NULL`
  with an internal fallback). Callers that explicitly passed
  `perception.fun = NULL` need to drop the argument or supply a function.
- `vmperception(m)` is now `vmperception(dm)` — the parameter is the
  difference between the limiting magnitude and the meteor magnitude, and
  the new name reflects that. Positional calls remain compatible.

# vismeteor 2.1.0

## Breaking changes

- `load_vmdb_rates()` and `load_vmdb_magnitudes()` now connect to an
  [imo-vmdb](https://pypi.org/project/imo-vmdb/) REST API instead of a
  direct database connection. 
- Multi-range filters for `period`, `sl`, and `lim_magn` (previously a
  matrix with multiple rows that were OR-joined) are no longer supported.
  Each filter is collapsed to a single bounding min/max. Use multiple calls
  combined with `rbind()` if disjoint ranges are needed.
- Minimum R version raised to **4.1.0** (was 3.5.0) due to use of the native pipe operator `|>` and `\()`.

# vismeteor 2.0.2

## Changes

- Clarified documentation and vignettes for `vmgeom` and `vmideal` models, including improved mathematical notation and explanations.
- Hidden internal parameters from exported function documentation to reduce user confusion.

# vismeteor 2.0.1

## Changes

- Updated README guidance, vignettes, and roxygen references to clarify data sources, models, and to correct documentation errors.
- Improved the performance of `vmgeom_vst_from_magn()` and `vmideal_vst_from_magn()` by tightening the interpolation steps used during the variance-stabilising transforms.
- Streamlined the `vmtable()` rounding routine to reduce allocations.
- Added a GitHub Actions workflow to run package checks automatically.
- Documented the derivation scripts in `inst/derivation/` to improve reproducibility.
- Added `load_vmdb()` regression tests.

# vismeteor 2.0.0

## Highlights
This release introduces variance-stabilizing transformations for the ideal distribution of visual meteor magnitudes (`vmideal_vst_from_magn()`) as well as for visual meteor magnitudes under a geometric distribution (`vmgeom_vst_from_magn()`).

## Other changes
The function `vmperception()` now better matches the perception probabilities of *Koschack & Rendtel (1990b)*.  
The argument `deriv_degree` has been removed, as it was only intended for internal testing and had no practical relevance for regular use.

Laplace-transformed perception probabilities have been replaced by variance-stabilizing transformations, which also means that the function `vmperception.l()` has been removed.

**Note:** This release includes breaking changes and is **not fully backward compatible** due to the removal of parameters and functions.
